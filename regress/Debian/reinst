# This regress test script attempts to give more confidence
# that the following things are OK:
#
# 1. that we can create the debian package;
#
# 2. that we can install the debian package when Neubot
#    is not installed and it will successfully create its
#    database and run;
#
# 3. that we can cleanly remove and reinstall when there
#    are or are not permissions to run tests;
#
# 4. that, when we reinstall, the notifier and the viewer
#    are correctly closed.
