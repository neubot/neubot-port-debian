# Stripped-down version of /etc/cron.daily/google-chrome, which
# reenables the repository if it was disabled during and upgrade,
# but does not touch it if the user disabled it manually.
# The user knows, the user rules.
# I'm sure it does not address all the corner cases but I don't
# understand why people should customize their debian setup that
# much.
# The original chrome code was looking for an english comment
# at the end of the script.  However I just found that the Italian
# Ubuntu appends a comment in italian.  To write robust code I
# have no choice but to look for a line followed by ANY comment.
